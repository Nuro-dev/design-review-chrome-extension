# Design Review Chrome Extension
DesignReview is a tool for creatives, managers, people who want to visually alter a web page, make a screenshot, and discuss with colleagues.

## Purpose
It was created as part of a tutorial on creating chrome extensions which showcase communication between `popup` and `contentscript` and `contentscript` to `backgroundscript`. 

## Result

The result is a chrome extension that enables the "hidden" designMode in chrome and after you are done you can take a screenshot with the edits on the page.
